| 2. Handling User Input                    | Read and validate user input (integer values).                |
| 3. Conditional Logic                      | Check correct/wrong answers and adjust scores.                |
| 4. Arithmetic Operations                  | Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  |
| 5. Function Implementation                | Write reusable functions for calculations and I/O operations. |
| 6. Working with Enums                     | Define and use enums for question difficulty and operations.  |
| 7. Structs for Data Organization          | Use `struct` to store quiz results and questions.             |
| 8. String Manipulation                    | Convert enums into readable text.                             |
| 9. Looping Through Questions              | Iterate over a list of questions using a loop.                |
| 10. Conditional Formatting                | Change screen color based on correct/wrong answers.           |
| 1.1 Validating User Input                 | Ensure user selects a valid difficulty and operation type.    |
| 1.2 Comparisons and Decision Making       | Determine pass/fail conditions based on scores.               |
| 1.3 Function Calls and Return Values      | Pass and return values between functions.                     |
| 1.4 Generating Mixed Questions            | Randomly assign question difficulty and operation type.       |
